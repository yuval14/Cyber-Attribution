# Cyber Attribution

A public knowledge repository for structured cyber attribution frameworks, references, and analytical notes.

## Purpose

This repository supports disciplined cyber attribution analysis. It is intended for analysts, cyber threat intelligence teams, incident responders, policy advisers, legal advisers, and national security practitioners who need a structured way to reason about the source, sponsorship, intent, and confidence level of cyber and information influence operations.

The core principle is to separate evidence from assessment. Analysts should document what is observed, what is inferred, what is externally sourced, what remains uncertain, and how confidence is expressed.

## Scope

| Area | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| Cyber threat intelligence | CTI lifecycle, use cases, products, operating model, collection, processing, analysis, dissemination, and feedback |
| Detection engineering | Sigma, YARA, YARA-L, Snort, Suricata, capa, ClamAV, IOC, IOA, IoPC, detection rules, capability rules, antivirus signatures, indicator types, rule quality, telemetry coverage, and detection to attribution limits |
| Threat hunting and machine learning | Machine learning assisted threat hunting, algorithm selection, anomaly detection, clustering, feature engineering, analyst validation, and retro-hunting workflows |
| Defensive frameworks | MITRE D3FEND, MITRE Engage, ATT&CK-to-defense mapping, defensive countermeasures, denial, deception, adversary engagement, and control validation |
| Vulnerability intelligence | KEV, CVSS, EPSS, CWE, CAPEC, CPE, OSV, GSD, vulnerability prioritisation, weakness classes, attack patterns, exploit likelihood, product matching, open source vulnerability mapping, and exposure-driven remediation |
| Cyber attribution frameworks | Analytical frameworks, workflows, confidence language, and reasoning discipline |
| Offensive planning and targeting | High-level military, intelligence, and national-security planning frameworks used to understand targeting logic, prioritisation, and integration of cyber effects into broader operations |
| Influence operations attribution | Frameworks and workflows for Information Influence Operations (IIO) and FIMI analysis |
| Investigation techniques | Structured analytic techniques, alternative hypotheses, challenge analysis, and pre-mortem review |
| Incident response frameworks | Incident response lifecycles, playbooks, CSIRT maturity, evidence preservation, and post incident learning |
| Evidence evaluation | Technical evidence, source reliability, alternative hypotheses, and uncertainty |
| Technical attribution | Malware, infrastructure, TTPs, tooling, timing, victimology, and campaign patterns |
| Strategic attribution | Intent, geopolitical context, operational continuity, sponsorship, and state responsibility |
| AI age attribution | False flags, synthetic artifacts, automated analysis, deception, and information operations |

## Analytical layers

| Layer | Main question | Example output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Technical attribution | What infrastructure, tools, malware, and behaviors were used? | Actor cluster, campaign family, technical indicators |
| Operational attribution | How was the operation planned and executed? | Campaign model, operational pattern, intrusion lifecycle |
| Strategic attribution | Why was the operation conducted, and who benefits? | Motive, intent, geopolitical context |
| Legal attribution | Can conduct be attributed to a state or legally responsible entity? | State responsibility assessment |
| Policy attribution | How should the assessment support response? | Public attribution, diplomacy, sanctions, legal action, or defensive response |
